<h1> The Escape</h1>
<h2> Prolougue </h2>
<div> This is your story. You can choose how you play it. Some of these paths will end in D&D. That stands for death and destruction. But if you play it right, you will win the game.
</div> <p>Your story begins now. Now you have two options. You can be a sixteen year old boy that comes from a poverty-stricked background, or a seventeen year old girl that was orphaned
at eight. If you choose the boy, you will begin to fight on the front lines of the war with the evil knight Ahriman's men. But if you
choose the girl, you will try to go to the king's bearer to tell them about the war. Both of these roles are extremely important. Which do you choose?
The kingdom rests in the balance.
